# Rifampicin-Theophylline-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Rifampicin-Theophylline-DDI studies for model evaluation

### Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Rifampicin-Theophylline-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied rifampicin model is an extended version of the [rifampicin model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Rifampicin-Model) published previously. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].

### License
The model is distributed under the [GPLv2 License](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Suite/blob/develop/LICENSE).
